  # The user's message is persisted by the controller *before* this job is
  # enqueued (see ChatsController/MessagesController#create), so the chat page
  # renders it immediately on load. That avoids the first-message race: the
  # previous `chat.ask(content)` created the user message inside the job and
  # broadcast it, which could fire before the browser had subscribed to the
  # chat's Turbo Stream — so the opening message was missed until a reload.
  #
  # Here we only generate the assistant reply with `complete`, streaming each
  # chunk into the assistant message's content target. That broadcast happens
  # after the LLM responds (seconds later), by which point the subscription is
  # reliably established.

    # Suppress the auto-broadcasts that `broadcasts_to` fires on message create
    # and update. On a new chat the `:async` adapter runs this job before the
    # browser completes its redirect + WebSocket handshake, so those broadcasts
    # land in SolidCable before the client subscribes. SolidCable replays only
    # from the subscription time, so they are never delivered. Instead we
    # broadcast once below — by then the LLM has responded (seconds later) and
    # the subscription is reliably established.
