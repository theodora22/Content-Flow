# LlmContext builds the layered system prompt that makes the chat assistant
# "creator-aware". It walks a chattable's ancestry chain and assembles a
# system instruction from the creator profile downward:
#
#   LinkedinPost -> Script -> Idea -> User -> Creator
#
# Each rung's text is owned by the model itself, via a `#system_prompt` method
# (e.g. `Idea#system_prompt`, `Script#system_prompt`). LlmContext is just the
# assembler: it knows the spine (which parent each node hangs off) and stacks
# each node's #system_prompt from the creator profile down:
#   - Idea          -> creator profile (name/topic/goal/audience)
#   - Script        -> creator profile + parent idea
#   - LinkedinPost  -> creator profile + parent idea + parent script
#                      (including the script's creator-authored custom_instructions)
#   - User          -> creator profile only (top-level chats)
#
# `Creator` itself owns no chats (see USER_JOURNEYS decision 4): brand context
# is always reached through `user.creator` (User#system_prompt delegates to it).
# The returned string is handed to `chat.with_instructions(...)` at chat
# creation, which persists it as one `role: :system` message.
#
# Extensibility: every platform output (LinkedIn today; Instagram and YouTube
# planned) is a sibling leaf hanging off the same Script -> Idea -> User ->
# Creator spine. Those upstream layers are shared, so a new platform costs one
# `when` branch in #layers_for plus its own leaf method (e.g. an
# `instagram_post_layer`) — nothing else changes.
#
# Platform guidelines: during *generation* the chattable is still the parent
# Script (the post doesn't exist yet), so the leaf layers above never run —
# there is nothing yet to describe "this Instagram post" with. To still tell
# the model how an Instagram caption differs from a Twitter thread (length,
# hook visibility, hashtags, tone, ...) we key a final layer off the chat's
# `purpose` instead of the chattable's class. It is appended whenever the
# purpose names a platform, regardless of whether the chattable is the parent
# Script (generating) or the post itself (refining later).
#
# Usage:
#   LlmContext.for(idea)                                    # => "You are ContentFlow's assistant...\n\n..."
#   LlmContext.for(script, purpose: "generate_instagram_post") # => "...\n\nPLATFORM GUIDELINES — INSTAGRAM\n..."
#   LlmContext.for(nil)                                     # => nil (standalone chat, no context)

      **PLATFORM GUIDELINES — LINKEDIN**
      - Only the first 2-3 lines (~200 characters) show in the feed before a
        "...see more" cut, so the hook has to earn the expand on its own —
        lead with the insight or tension, not a warm-up.
      - Write the body as short, scannable paragraphs with blank lines between
        them; dense blocks get scrolled past. One idea per paragraph.
      - Tone is professional but personal and first-person — credible and
        value-driven, sharing a lesson or point of view. Avoid hype, buzzwords,
        and engagement-bait phrasing.
      - Title is an internal label for this app only — it is never shown on
        LinkedIn, so it doesn't need to read like part of the post.
      - Close with a question or invitation to discuss, and 3-5 relevant
        hashtags on their own line at the end.
    TEXT
  end

  def instagram_guidelines_layer
    <<~TEXT.strip
      **SCRIPT GUIDELINES — INSTAGRAM REEL**
      - The script is spoken on camera — no emojis, no written-post language.
      - Max 130 words (~45 seconds). Cut everything that isn't essential.
      - Never open with "Hey", "Hello", or a self-introduction.
        Start with a strong hook that earns attention in the first 3 seconds.
      - Structure: hook → one main point → one call-to-action.

      **CAPTION GUIDELINES — INSTAGRAM**
      - Feeds truncate the caption after roughly 125 characters behind a
        "...more" tap, so the hook has to land as a scroll-stopper entirely on
        its own, with no setup from the rest of the caption.
      - Title is an internal label for this app only — it is never shown on
        Instagram, so it doesn't need to read like part of the caption.
      - Write the body in short lines with blank lines between thoughts; a
        wall of text reads as skippable on a phone, broken-up lines don't.
      - Tone is casual, visual-first, and personal — like talking to a
        follower, not announcing to an audience. Emojis are welcome where
        they add warmth, not stacked as decoration.
      - Close with 3-5 hashtags that are actually relevant to this post
        (not a generic stack of 30) and one clear call-to-action: save,
        share, comment, or follow.
    TEXT

  def twitter_guidelines_layer
    <<~TEXT.strip
      **PLATFORM GUIDELINES — TWITTER**
      - The hook is the opening tweet and must work as a complete, standalone
        thought under 280 characters — most readers see only it in their feed
        and decide whether to expand the thread from it alone.
      - The body continues as a thread: write it as a sequence of tweet-sized
        beats (roughly 280 characters each), one idea per beat, in the order
        they should be read — not as a single continuous paragraph.
      - Tone is direct, punchy, and conversational — shorter sentences and a
        more opinionated edge than a LinkedIn post; say the thing plainly
        rather than building up to it.
      - Use hashtags sparingly, if at all (0-2, woven into a sentence) —
        stacking them at the end reads as spam on this platform.
