#
# Chat.destroy_all goes first and clears *all* chats — including standalone
# chats (chattable: nil) from the /chats flow, which no owner's
# `dependent: :destroy` would reach. It cascades to messages via acts_as_chat.

# One entry per creator. Each creator owns a user account and 3 ideas. Every

# direct post per platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram): the idea's posts
# live under the flat `linkedin_post:` / `twitter_post:` / `instagram_post:`
# keys, the script's under the nested `script_posts:` hash. Looping over this
# structure keeps the creation logic in one place instead of repeating
# `create!` calls 100+ times.

            Most AI tools promise to 10x your content output.

            Only 3 actually delivered.

            1. ChatGPT for first drafts — fast, but needs heavy editing
            2. Midjourney for visuals — the quality is genuinely impressive
            3. Descript for video editing — cuts production time in half

            The secret? AI works best as a thinking partner, not a replacement.

            1/ ChatGPT: best for first drafts. Plan on rewriting half of it — but half a draft beats a blank page.

            2/ Midjourney: genuinely impressive. The gap between AI visuals and stock photos is closing fast.

            3/ Descript: cuts video editing time in half. If you're on camera at all, try this.

            Bottom line: use AI as a thinking partner, not a ghostwriter.

            ✦ Descript — video editing without the pain

            The mindset shift that changed everything: AI as a creative collaborator, not a replacement.

            Productivity isn't about working less.

            It's about making the hours you work actually count.

            Three things that moved the needle for me:

            1. One deep-work block before email
            2. A hard stop — deadlines create focus
            3. Saying no to "quick calls"

            Optimise for output, not for a smaller number on the clock.

            1/ Working fewer hours isn't the goal. Doing fewer *wrong* things is.

            2/ My non-negotiables:
            → Deep work block before email opens
            → A hard stop time (constraints create focus)
            → No "quick calls" that aren't quick

            3/ The metric to optimise: did meaningful work get done today?

            Hours are vanity. Output is sanity.

            Productivity culture sold you a fantasy.

            Fewer hours ≠ better life if the hours you have are filled with noise.

            What actually works:

            ✦ One protected deep-work block — before Slack, before email
            ✦ A real end time — deadlines you make for yourself
            ✦ Fewer meetings, full stop

            You don't need a shorter workday. You need a fuller one.

              Mathematically, the avalanche wins. Behaviourally, the snowball does.

              ✦ First win in weeks — not years

              ✦ You actually open your banking app again

              A plan you stick to beats a plan that's optimal.

            1. Buys a tiny slice of hundreds of companies
            2. Charges almost nothing in fees

            Most people undereat protein because it gets boring.

            Easy swaps that fixed it for me:

            1. Greek yogurt instead of cereal
            2. Eggs on everything
            3. A protein shake as a default snack

            Variety is what makes a diet stick.

            1/ Chicken breast + rice is a fine meal. The 5th time. Not the 35th.

            2/ Easy protein swaps that don't feel like a chore:
            → Greek yogurt instead of cereal (18–20g, done)
            → Eggs on everything (lunch, dinner, snacks)
            → Protein shake as a default snack, not a post-workout ritual

            3/ Variety is the real protocol. If you can't sustain it, it doesn't work.

            Most people undereat protein because the \"healthy\" options feel like punishment.

            Easy swaps that actually stick:

            ✦ Greek yogurt at breakfast — ~20g before you've even started
            ✦ Eggs on everything — lunch, dinner, whatever
            ✦ Protein shake as a snack — not just post-workout

            You don't need a perfect meal plan. You need options you'll keep reaching for.

              Front-load instead:

              1. 30g at breakfast before anything else
              2. Anchor every meal around the protein first
              3. Keep one zero-effort option in the fridge

              1/ Cereal, toast, coffee — most breakfasts are a protein zero. The day never recovers.

              2/ The fix:
              → 30g before anything else
              → Build each meal around protein first
              → One zero-effort backup always in the fridge

              3/ Win breakfast and the daily target stops being a chase.

            I used to think seniority was about syntax.

            It's not. It's about judgement.

            What changed for me:

            1. Asking "should we?" before "how do we?"
            2. Writing code my teammates can delete
            3. Reducing scope instead of adding it

          body: <<~BODY
            1/ Junior me thought seniority meant knowing more syntax. I was wrong.

            2/ The real gaps:
            → "Should we build this?" before "How do we build this?"
            → Writing code your team can change or delete without fear
            → Shrinking scope instead of expanding it

            3/ Technical skill gets you in the room. Judgement gets you promoted.

            ✦ "Should we build this?" before "How do we?"
            ✦ "Will my team be able to change this in a year?"
            ✦ "What can we cut?" instead of what can we add?

            Code is the easy part. Decisions are the actual job.

            ✦ Set breakpoints, watch data transform

            Perfect sustainability is a trap.

            It makes people give up before they start.

            What actually works:

            1. Change one habit at a time
            2. Use what you already own
            3. Celebrate small wins

            A million people doing it imperfectly beats a handful doing it perfectly.

          body: <<~BODY
            1/ The all-or-nothing approach to sustainability has convinced millions of people that they can't start until they're ready to go all in. They never start.

            2/ What works instead:
            → One habit changed, for real
            → Using what you already own (no new "eco" purchases)
            → Celebrating progress without scorekeeping

            3/ A million people doing it imperfectly > a handful doing it perfectly.

            What's the one sustainable habit you've actually kept?

            Sustainability perfectionism is a trap.

            It makes people feel like they can't do anything unless they can do everything.

            The approach that actually works:

            ✦ Change one thing at a time — and actually change it
            ✦ Use what you already own before buying "eco" alternatives
            ✦ Celebrate the small wins without comparing

            A million people making imperfect choices beats a handful living perfectly.

            Progress over perfection. Always. 🌱

              Grand eco-resolutions die by February.

            Fast fashion feels like a bargain.

            The real price shows up elsewhere:

            1. Garment workers underpaid
            2. Landfills overflowing
            3. Clothes that fall apart in a season

            Buy less. Buy better. Wear it longer.

          body: <<~BODY
            1/ Fast fashion externalized its costs so well that consumers stopped seeing them.

            2/ Where the price actually goes:
            → Garment workers paid below a living wage
            → Landfills filling faster than they empty
            → Clothes designed to last one season

            3/ You don't have to buy expensive. You have to buy less.

            Buy less. Buy better. Wear it longer.

            Fast fashion makes you feel like you're getting a deal.

            You're not. The cost gets transferred.

            Where the real price goes:

            ✦ Garment workers — underpaid in unsafe conditions
            ✦ The environment — landfills, water pollution, CO2
            ✦ Your wardrobe — clothes designed to fall apart in a season

            The fix isn't buying expensive. It's buying less.

            Buy less. Buy better. Wear it until it dies. Then repair it.

              Most impulse buys fail the question instantly.

              The 30-wears test works because:

              1. It filters trends from wardrobe staples
              2. It reframes price as cost-per-wear
              3. It takes five seconds at the till

              The most sustainable garment is the one you keep wearing.

              1/ Most fast-fashion purchases get worn fewer than 10 times. Some never.

              2/ Why the test works:
              → Filters trends from staples
              → Turns price into cost-per-wear
              → Takes 5 seconds at the checkout

              The most sustainable piece in any wardrobe is the one that gets worn for years.

            You have more options than you think:

            1. A sealed countertop bin
            2. A local drop-off or community garden
            3. Bokashi for the truly tiny kitchen

            A third of household waste is organic. This is the easiest win there is.

          body: <<~BODY
            1/ The space excuse is real. But there are options that fit any kitchen.

            2/ What works without a garden:
            → Sealed countertop bin — no smell, no fuss
            → Local drop-off point or community garden (most cities have them)
            → Bokashi fermentation — works in the tiniest spaces, no odour

            3/ ~30% of household waste is organic. Composting is the highest-impact kitchen habit there is.

            No garden required.

            The "I need a garden" excuse is the most common one I hear.

            It's also the easiest to solve.

            Apartment composting options that actually work:

            ✦ Sealed countertop bin — zero smell, surprisingly compact
            ✦ Local drop-off or community garden — most cities have them (check your council)
            ✦ Bokashi system — fermentation, not decomposition, works in the tiniest kitchen

            About a third of what goes in your bin is organic waste.

            Composting is one of the highest-impact habits you can build at home. 🌿

#
# fetched_at is stamped to "now" so the sources aren't stale: a Refresh won't
# try to re-fetch them over the network and overwrite this demo data.

# No explicit cleanup is needed — User.destroy_all above cascades through
# `has_many :substack_sources, dependent: :destroy` (and on to posts).
